I mean seriously, if you don't know what PPR means, why are you even here? KIDDING! Below are some high level scoring & settings highlights. All of this information can be found in Sleeper, but I'm a nerd and like creating shit like this. 

## General
- PPR Scoring
- Free Agency: $100 FAAB
- No Kickers or DST
- Regular Season: 14 Weeks
- Playoffs: start week 15 (1 week per round)

## Draft
As of right now the draft is scheduled for Wednesday, September 7th at 7pm Central. You will get up to 2 minutes per pick.

Draft Order will be randomized 3 times once league fills. This will be the final draft order.

## FAAB
So what does FAAB mean? Well, Sleeper does a pretty good job at explaining [here](https://support.sleeper.app/en/articles/1876040-how-does-faab-bidding-work).

You get $100 and it lasts all season long. Minimum bid is $0.
