## General
So what is [Sleeper](https://sleeper.app/) exactly? If you've used Sleeper in the past, you might agree it's one of the best fantasy platforms today. If you're new to using Sleeper, go get the app and check it out! In the upper-right hand corner of this page there are links to our [League](https://sleeper.app/leagues/728678177018347520) homepage, as well as Sleeper [support](https://support.sleeper.app/en/).

The mobile app uses swipe navigation, and is very user friendly. The web app is pretty decent too.

Go check out all of the [Features](https://sleeper.app/fantasy-football) Sleeper has to offer.

## League Chat
I'll always post in League Chat and PIN important information. All you have to do is look for the little PIN icon in chat. Easy right?
